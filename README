IronRuby-stats

A script for capturing interesting statistics about IronRuby

== Pre-requisites
1. git clone git://github.com/ironruby/ironruby.git
2. Set up IronRuby for building: http://wiki.github.com/ironruby/ironruby

== Configuration

Update config.rb with the path to your IronRuby repository (from step 1 above).

For example, if you ran the "git clone" command in c:/dev, then this would be
your REPO value:

REPO = 'c:/dev/ironruby'

== Usage

ruby stats.rb [--all] [--build] [--binary] [--repo] [--startup] [--throughput] [-h|--help]
